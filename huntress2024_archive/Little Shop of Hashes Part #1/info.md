 *In the packet, secrets lie,  
 Whispers of data pass by,  
 Encrypted shadows creep,  
 While the watchful eyes peep.*    
 Are you able to unravel the attack chain? The first question is:  
 **What is the name of the service that the attacker ran and stopped, which dumped hashes on the first compromised host?**   
   
  
 ***NOTE: Flags for Part \#1 to Part \#5 will all be human\-readable answers and in a non\-standard flag format. You will use the same downloadable attachment and log files to answer all the questions.***

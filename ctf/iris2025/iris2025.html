            <p class="centered-text">Iris2025 was kind of spur-of-the-moment, and I unfortunately ended up getting sick so I started late.</p>
            <p class="centered-text">Going into this, I knew I wouldn't have the energy to place well, so I decided to pick a couple Forensics challenges and create some thoughtful writeups :)</p>

                <p>Here at EI Corp, ethics are our top priority! That's why our IT team was shocked when we got a knock from our ISP informing us that someone on our computer network was involved in some illegitimate activity. Who would do that? Don't they know that's illegal?</p>
                <p>Our ISP's knocking (and so is HR), and we need someone to hold accountable. Can you find out who committed this violation?</p>

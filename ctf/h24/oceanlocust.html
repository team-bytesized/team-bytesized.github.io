        <h2>Challenge Name: ocean_locust</h2>
        <p>Category: Malware</p>
        <p>Author: @JohnHammond</p>

        <h3>Challenge Description:</h3>
        <p><b>Wow-ee zow-ee!!</b> Some advanced persistent threats have been doing some tricks with hiding payloads in image files!</p>

        <h3>Artifact Files:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../../h24_files/OceanLocust/ocean_locust.7z">ocean_locust.7z</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>After unzipping the archive, we are presented with two executables and an image file, "inconspicuous.png".</p>
        <img src="../../h24_files/OceanLocust/inconspicuous.png" alt="Inconspicuous Image">
        <p>I started by running both executables and noted that the binaries are written in rust, and that they both required an image and flag as input. Because I have no clue how to reverse rust, I decided to take a look at the image file.</p>
        <img src="../../h24_files/OceanLocust/first-run.png" alt="Image for Question 1">
        <p>I took a look at the png image in 010 editor, and noticed a handful of ancillary data chunks, with types "biTa" through "biTh". These chunks all contained 5 bytes of data, which made me think that they were XORed, with the key being the name of the chunk. </p>
        <img src="../../h24_files/OceanLocust/png-chunks.png" alt="PNG Chunks">
        <p>I decided to test my theory by decoding the first chunk in alphabetical order, XORing its data against the chunk type "biT[letter]", and was pleased to see that the first few characters of the flag were revealed.</p>
        <p>I did this using binary refinery, emitting the bytes, carving out the hex structure for the biTa chunk, and then XORing it against "biTa".</p>
        <img src="../../h24_files/OceanLocust/test-xor.png" alt="Chunk Decoding">
        <p>I wrote a script to automate the process of decoding the chunks, and after a few iterations, the flag was revealed. </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
import struct

def parse(data):
    decoded_data = b""
    for letter in range(ord("a"), ord("h") + 1):  # biTa to biTh
        chunk_name = f"biT{chr(letter)}".encode()
        if chunk_name in data:
            start_index = data.index(chunk_name) + len(chunk_name)
            additional_data = data[start_index : start_index + 6]
            unpacked_data = struct.unpack("6B", additional_data)
            decoded_data += bytes(
                a ^ b for a, b in zip(unpacked_data[:5], [*chunk_name, chunk_name[0]])
            )
    print(decoded_data.strip(b"\xaa").decode())  # some padding bytes at the end


parse(open("inconspicuous.png", "rb").read())   
        </code></pre>
        <p>Flag:<code class="challenge">flag{fec87c690b8ec8d65b8bb10ee7bb65d0}</code></p>
        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>Initially I was afraid that I would have to reverse rust, which sent me into cold sweats, so I was happily surprised when I was able to grab the flag directly from the image :)</p>
